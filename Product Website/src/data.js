    info:
      "The iPhone 13 Pro Max is Apple's biggest iPhone, but it doens't have any advantages over the iPhone 13 Pro in terms of features, unlike in previous generations. It's heavy and unwieldy, but the big display is great for games and the increased battery capacity allows for nearly two full days of regular use. The display gets a 120Hz refresh rate, but there's still an unsightly notch that interferes with movies. Performance is great thanks to the A15 Bionic SoC. You can choose betweeen 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage options. The main new features are camera-related: Cinematic Mode and Photographic Styles. The camera hardware has also been improved, compared to the previous generation. You can now take macros and the optical zoom goes up to 3X. Although incredibly expensive, the iPhone 13 Pro Max represents the best of the best in the iPhone lineup.",

      "OnePlus hasn't gone too crazy with the design of the OnePlus 9 Pro. It uses a 6.7-inch LTPO OLED display which the company claims cuts power consumption by up to 50 percent compared to the previous model. It's powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 SoC, and is available in two varaints. I was happy with the accuracy of the in-display fingerprint sensor, and I also like the fact that the edges of the display are slightly less curved compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro, which helps in preventing accidental touches",
